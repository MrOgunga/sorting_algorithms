All about sorting algorithms
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, ‚Ä¶ is totally forbidden.
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h Don‚Äôt forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
